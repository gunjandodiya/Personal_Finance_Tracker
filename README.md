### Project Structure & Workflow
This Excel-based project follows a 3-layer architecture:

📑 Dataset (Dataset sheet): Contains raw monthly records of income and expenses
📊 Pivot Analysis (Calculations sheet): Builds dynamic Pivot Tables for summarization
📈 Dashboard Layer (Dashboard sheet): Visualizes insights using charts, cards, and graphs

##🧾 Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project captures real-life finance entries across various categories:

Column Name	Description
Date	Date of the transaction (dd-mm-yyyy)
Type	Income or Expense
Category	Spending/earning category (e.g. Housing, Job)
Amount	Transaction amount
Source	Platform/source of income (YouTube, Job, etc)
Day	Weekday name (Mon, Tue, etc.) for trend analysis
Month	Month name (Jan, Feb, etc.) for trend charts
🧪 Feature Engineering (Excel Formula-Based)
To enhance analysis and build insightful visualizations, we performed feature extraction from the raw Date column:

New Column	Formula Used (in Excel)	Description
Month	=TEXT(A2, "mmm")	Extracts 3-letter month name from Date
Day	=TEXT(A2, "ddd")	Extracts weekday name (Mon, Tue, etc.) from Date
These columns are crucial for:

Monthly trend analysis in bar charts
Weekday spending pattern visualization
Grouping data in Pivot Tables dynamically
🧠 These transformations allow the dashboard to stay dynamic, filterable, and timeline-aware.

🔍 Primary Analysis (Pivot Table Layer)
The Calculations sheet is dedicated to:

Creating Pivot Tables for income and expense aggregation
Calculating KPIs like total income, total spending, available balance
Deriving monthly and weekly trends
Feeding structured results into the dashboard using linked cells
💡 This sheet acts as the engine powering the dashboard – update the Data sheet, and everything auto-updates.
